# DONZO
It is a program that automatically scans all your files and arranges them in different directories based on their extensions.

# Installation
## Linux
1. Firstly clone the repository.
2. Compile the "donzo.cc" file using your choice of compiler. (I personally used g++)
   g++ donzo.cc -o donzo
4. Then move it to System Path.
   sudo mv donzo /usr/local/bin/
5. Enjoy!

## Windows
your own your own for this, i'll update it later.

# Usage
Just go to the cluttered directory and type 'donzo'. See it happen in front of your eyes.
